\section{Technologies Used}
The laser scanner is controlled with an Arduino Uno, running a simple program that
rotates moves the stepper motor by one step when it receives a message. Communication
with the Arduino is controlled by a Python program which made use of the
\href{https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial}{pySerial} library in order to send messages
to the Arduino. Data is captured by two Logitech webcams, which are controlled with
\href{http://opencv.org}{OpenCV}.
